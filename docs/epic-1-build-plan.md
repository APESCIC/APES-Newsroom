# Epic #1 build plan: APES Newsroom (replacing Ghost)

Source: [Issue #1](https://github.com/APESCIC/APES-Newsroom/issues/1) and its sub-issues (#2–#11, #18).

**Delivery status (2026-08-06):** Engineering acceptance for #2–#10 and #18
landed on `main`; the watched beta deploy, rollback drill, live OIDC/LDAP proof,
and named governance/accessibility approvals were recorded on their issues.
Production cutover was separately authorized and completed under
[#11](https://github.com/APESCIC/APES-Newsroom/issues/11#issuecomment-5208865545).
The Newsroom is live at `www.apesnews.org.uk`; the former Ghost app remains
stopped and recoverable, its retirement is not authorized, and the apex DNS
record was not switched during cutover.

## Delivered system

One Laravel 13 + Inertia/React app runs on the existing Cloudron LAMP app
(`74a2a784-a161-4787-84ff-2b8efc957bc8`), with two surfaces: a public SEO
newsroom for three APES channels (CIC, Shelter & Rescue, Pet Care Clinic), and
authenticated workspaces for publishing, campaigns, moderation, and governance.
Public accounts use password/magic-link login; staff use Cloudron OIDC + LDAP
role mapping. Content is versioned Editor.js JSON with a server-enforced block
allowlist. Mailing lists are per-channel, double opt-in, and queued through
Cloudron SMTP. Ghost content and members were imported from exported files with
fail-closed consent handling; no import sent email.

Shared contracts used across multiple issues: `Role` (public/staff/admin/super_admin), `PostStatus` (draft/in_review/scheduled/published/unpublished/deleted), `MailingList` (apes_cic/apes_shelter_rescue/apes_pet_care_clinic), `ModerationStatus` (private/pending/approved/rejected/suspended), `ReactionType` (helpful/support/thank_you).

## Authorization boundary (applies throughout)

Completion of an issue does **not** authorize a new production deployment,
Cloudron hostname or DNS change, live campaign send, or deletion/retirement of
Ghost. Production cutover received its own recorded authorization on #11; that
authorization does not extend to later operational actions.

## Phases

**Phase 0 — Foundation (parallel tracks)**
- **#3 Laravel foundation & guarded Cloudron delivery.** Laravel 13/Inertia/React/TS/PHP 8.4, MySQL, Redis, health endpoint, CI (backend, frontend, lint, types, security, prod build), protected deployment environment, the full guarded-deploy sequence (backup → versioned artifact → migrate → activate → verify workers/scheduler → health/smoke → rollback). Nothing else can be built without this. Recommended starting point.
- **#2 Design: IA & visual system.** Sitemap, navigation, responsive wireframes/prototypes, component inventory, design tokens, email template designs, WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility annotations. This is a design deliverable, not code — can run in parallel with #3, but frontend work in #4–#8 shouldn't proceed past scaffolding until relevant flows here are stakeholder-approved.

**Phase 1 — Identity**
- **#4 Public accounts + Cloudron staff RBAC.** Depends on #3. Establishes the `Role` contract every later authorization check (#5, #7, #8) relies on: public registration/magic-link/password reset, staff via OIDC+LDAP group mapping, fail-closed reconciliation, full authz test matrix.

**Phase 2 — Content and reading (parallel once #4 lands)**
- **#5 Editor.js publishing/approval/scheduling/SEO workflow.** Depends on #3, #4. Defines the post schema, block allowlist, revision/approval/scheduling state machine, SEO fields, transaction-safe publish. #6 and #9 both build on this schema, so it should land before or alongside #6 rather than after.
- **#6 Public newsroom & article discovery.** Depends on #3, #2 (approved page designs), and effectively #5 (needs a post schema to render against, even if seeded with fixtures early). Homepage, channel pages, article/author/search/archive, RSS/sitemap/structured data, redirects, accessibility.

**Phase 3 — Engagement**
- **#7 Mailing lists, consent, queued campaigns.** Depends on #4 (accounts/contacts) and #5 (the email-this-post flag and approval-time content snapshot live in the publishing workflow). Double opt-in, per-list unsubscribe, consent ledger, Cloudron SMTP queued send, throttling. Runtime mailing product only — Ghost member import is #18.
- **#8 Moderated profiles, comments, reactions.** Depends on #4 (accounts) and #6 (article pages to attach to). Private-by-default profiles, pre-moderated comments, three toggleable reactions.

**Phase 4 — Content import**
- **#9 Import Ghost posts, media, and redirects from content export.** Depends on #5 (target content schema) and #6 (target slugs/redirects) being stable. File-based import from Ghost content JSON + media archive. Dry-run, resumable/idempotent, no email from import runs. Mailing/members/consent are out of scope (see #18).

**Phase 5 — Governance (continuous + gated)**
- **#10 GDPR/PECR/security/accessibility governance.** Not a phase that starts after everything else — threat modeling, CSRF/authz/rate-limit controls, CI security checks, and accessibility checks should be built into #3–#9 as they're written. What's specific to #10 is the formal artifact: data inventory, retention schedule, privacy/cookie copy, rights workflows, recorded legal/compliance and accessibility approvals as an explicit launch gate before #18 and #11.

**Phase 5b — Mailing import (pre-cutover)**
- **#18 Admin importer: Ghost members CSV → mailing lists.** Depends on #7 (target contact/consent/suppression models) and runs after #10 formal gates, immediately before #11. Admin-panel file importer (Inertia/React): authorized admins upload a Ghost members CSV, validate headers, dry-run, confirm import, and view a reconciliation report. Queued/idempotent server job; mailing contacts (not accounts); fail-closed three-list activation; suppressions; no email from dry-run or import runs.

**Phase 6 — Cutover**
- **#11 Validate, cut over apesnews.org.uk, retire Ghost safely.** Depends on everything above. Beta acceptance across every surface (including separate content import and **admin-panel** mailing CSV dry-runs), throughput benchmarking, backup/restore/rollback drills, then — only after separate production authorization — the guarded cutover with final content import then final admin-panel mailing import from the uploaded Ghost members CSV, and a defined rollback window. Ghost retirement is a further separate authorization after that window.

## Current follow-up boundaries

- [Issue #36](https://github.com/APESCIC/APES-Newsroom/issues/36) is a new
  stakeholder-gated theme exploration and is not evidence that the original
  delivery phases remain incomplete.
- Ghost stays recoverable until a separate retirement/deletion approval.
- The apex `apesnews.org.uk` DNS record remains a separately governed change if
  APES CIC chooses to point it at Cloudron/`www`.
- Live campaign sends require an explicit operational decision and fresh
  consent/suppression checks.
- Dated plans in `docs/superpowers/plans/` are historical implementation
  records; unchecked boxes there are not the current backlog.
