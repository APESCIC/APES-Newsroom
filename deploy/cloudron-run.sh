# ONE-TIME MANUAL SETUP. This file is a reference to copy to
# /app/data/run.sh via the Cloudron File Manager (or `cloudron push`).
# Cloudron's LAMP app runs /app/data/run.sh before the app starts on every
# boot/restart (docs.cloudron.io/packages/lamp#custom-startup-script).
#
# It does two things:
#   1. Runs the queue worker in the background, against whatever release
#      /app/data/current currently points to.
#   2. PHP session storage must live under /run, not the read-only
#      filesystem (docs.cloudron.io/packaging/cheat-sheet#php).
#
# The scheduler is NOT started here - it runs via Cloudron's own per-app
# Cron feature (dashboard -> app -> Cron), not this script. See
# docs/deployment.md for the exact entry to add there.
